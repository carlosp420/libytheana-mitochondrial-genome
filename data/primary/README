This folder contains all the primary data.

Primary data is data that cannot be generated by running the analysis
scripts. Typically, this is data generated by the researcher himself, or coming
from another source (collaborator, public database which was manually
downloaded).

The content of this folder should be backed up. If the files are small, they
can potentially be version-controlled.
